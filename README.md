# Overview-of-AI-ML-and-DL

#### AI (Artificial Intelligence):
                         A broad field enabling computers to mimic human behavior.

#### . NLP (Natural Language Processing):

- Speech Recognition: Converts spoken language to text (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
- Speech Synthesis: Converts text to spoken language.


#### . Computer Vision:

- Image Recognition: Detects and classifies objects in images.

#### ML (Machine Learning):
                A subset of AI where algorithms learn from data to make predictions.

#### End-to-End Cycle:

- Data Collection

- Data Preprocessing

- Model Training

- Model Evaluation

- Model Deployment

#### DL (Deep Learning): A subset of ML using neural networks with many layers.

   #### Deep Neural Networks:

  - Neurons and Layers: Process input data and pass output through layers.
    
  - Backpropagation: Adjusts weights to minimize loss.


#### Gen AI (Generative AI): A subset of DL focused on models generating new data similar to training data.

### Key Topics in ML and DL

   #### Introduction to Machine Learning:

     - Classification: E.g., Evaluating a learner’s profile to determine course suitability.
     
     - Regression: E.g., Predicting the probability of a learner’s success.

#### Introduction to Deep Learning:

   #### Architecture:

   - Input Layer: Receives raw image data.

   - Convolutional Layers: Apply filters to extract features.

   - ReLU: Introduces non-linearity.

   - Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions.

   - Flattening: Converts data to a single vector.

   - Fully Connected Layers: Aggregate features for classification.

   - Output Layer: Provides probabilities for each class.


#### Case Study Applications:

   - Course Enrollment: Using ML to evaluate learner profiles and predict success and placement probabilities.
     
   - Medical Diagnosis: Using DL and CNNs to detect TB/Pneumonia from X-ray images by automatically learning features and patterns.
